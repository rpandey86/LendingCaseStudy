## General Information
A consumer finance company has whose business is lending money to various types to customers. 
The company needs to determine the eligibility of the cusotmer for the loan applied depending upon cusotmer profile. 
The company needs to do risk assessment of the loan based on customer profile.
There are two types of risks 
i). Customer is 'likely to pay loan' then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
ii). Customer is 'not likely to repay the loan' then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. 

If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 

Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan. Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company

## Conclusions
Following elements can be used by company as driving factors to determine loan processing.
